<p>Onam is one of the most important festivals of Kerala, celebrated with immense happiness and cultural pride. It takes place in the Malayalam month of Chingam, usually between August and September. The festival commemorates the return of the beloved King Mahabali, who is remembered for his generosity and just rule. According to legend, Lord Vishnu’s Vamana avatar granted Mahabali permission to visit his people once every year, and this occasion is celebrated as Onam.The ten-day festival is marked with several traditions. Homes are decorated with Pookalam, intricate floral designs that grow larger each day. Families come together to enjoy Onasadya, the grand vegetarian feast served on banana leaves. Boat races, dances, music, and games create a lively atmosphere. In 2025, Onam begins on 26 August and ends with Thiruvonam on 5 September. It is a festival that symbolizes unity, prosperity, and Kerala’s rich cultural heritage.</p>
<p>In addition, traditional dances such as Thiruvathira, Kathakali, and Pulikali add colour and joy to the festivities. Communities come together to sing, dance, and enjoy games and fairs. Onam is more than a festival—it is a symbol of Kerala’s unity, gratitude for the harvest, and pride in its traditions. In 2025, Onam will be celebrated from 26 August to 5 September, with Thiruvonam on 5 September as the main day of joy and togetherness.</p>
