<p>Vegetables are the edible parts of various plants—like roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits—that are typically consumed for their savory flavor and nutritional value. They are vital for human health, providing essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber that support digestion and immunity. Vegetables add color, flavor, and texture to meals, from crunchy carrots and leafy spinach to juicy tomatoes and savory broccoli. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or prepared in countless dishes, but are generally distinguished from sweet desserts and often come from herbaceous plants with soft stems.
