<p>Holi, or the "Festival of Colors," is an ancient Indian and Nepalese Hindu festival celebrating the arrival of spring, the triumph of good over evil, and the beginning of a new season of love and joy. Celebrated on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Phalgun (late February/early March), Holi involves a night of bonfires called Holika Dahan and a day of vibrant celebrations where people throw colored powders and water, sing, dance, and share festive sweets. The festival symbolizes forgiveness and the mending of relationships.
