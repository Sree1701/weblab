<p>Diwali, popularly known as the Festival of Lights, is one of India’s most important and widely celebrated festivals. Its origins can be traced back to ancient legends, most notably the story of Lord Rama’s return to Ayodhya after fourteen years of exile and his victory over the demon king Ravana. The residents of Ayodhya welcomed him by lighting clay lamps, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil and the restoration of righteousness.</p>
<p>In 2025, Diwali will be celebrated on 21st October. The festival spans over several days, each with unique customs. Preparations begin with thorough cleaning and decorating of homes. People create vibrant rangoli designs at entranceways and adorn interiors with diyas and fairy lights. The main day of Diwali involves performing Lakshmi Puja, where families pray to Goddess Lakshmi for prosperity and to Lord Ganesha for wisdom.</p>
<p>Diwali is also associated with other legends across India. In some regions, it commemorates Goddess Lakshmi’s emergence from the ocean during Samudra Manthan, and in eastern India, it is observed as Kali Puja. In southern India, the festival marks Lord Krishna’s victory over the demon Narakasura. Despite these regional differences, the core message remains the same—celebrating the victory of light over darkness.</p>
<p>The joy of togetherness is a major aspect of Diwali. People visit each other, exchange gifts and sweets, and take part in community festivities. In schools and colleges, students present essays, speeches, and art depicting the festival’s significance. Today, there is a growing awareness about safe and eco-friendly celebrations—preferring clay diyas over plastic, minimizing firecracker use, and sharing goodness beyond social boundaries.
Diwali in 2025 offers a chance to reaffirm values like kindness, honesty, and unity, and to celebrate India’s vibrant heritage and cultural diversity.</p>
