<p>Trees are perennial plants with a woody trunk, supporting branches and leaves. They are vital for life, providing the oxygen we breathe through photosynthesis while absorbing carbon dioxide. Trees offer shade, habitat for wildlife, food, and materials for furniture and paper. Their roots prevent soil erosion and help control climate by regulating rainfall and temperature. From providing medicines to making landscapes beautiful, trees are essential to ecological balance and human well-being, making their protection crucial for a healthy planet.
